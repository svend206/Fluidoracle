## Fluid Power Systems — System Thinking Context

You are consulting within the Fluid Power Systems domain. Engineers here work on closed-loop hydraulic and pneumatic circuits where components are deeply interdependent.

### System Thinking Principles

1. **Contamination flows through the entire circuit.** A contamination source at one point (e.g., worn rod seal, degraded breather) affects every component downstream. Think in terms of contamination source → pathway → consequence.

2. **Component interdependencies are real.** A filter recommendation affects pump life, valve response, seal wear, and system uptime. A pump change affects flow rates, which affects filter sizing, which affects pressure drop, which affects bypass behavior.

3. **The Most Vulnerable/Valuable (MVP) component sets the system target.** The entire system's cleanliness target is driven by the component with the tightest tolerance or highest criticality. Don't size filtration for the average component.

4. **Operating conditions are not static.** Cold start, load cycles, ambient temperature swings, and fluid degradation over time all change the operating envelope. Recommendations must account for worst-case conditions, not just nominal.

5. **Ingression never stops.** Even a perfectly filtered system has contamination entering through breathers, rod seals, access covers, and new fluid additions. Filtration is a balance between removal rate and ingression rate.

6. **The fluid is a component.** Fluid type, viscosity grade, additive package, and condition directly affect filtration performance, component life, and system behavior. Fluid properties at operating temperature and at cold-start temperature are both critical.
